    AST_annex_new_zealand_desc:0 "While not a particularly popular idea amongst the citizens of New Zealand, the worthiness of the island nation as an independent state is questionable.

    annex_vichy_france_desc:0 "The time has come to put an end to the pretension of the so called 'Vichy State'. Their commitment to the cause of fascism is questionable, at best, and we're in dire need of their resources.

    GER_fall_gelb:0 "The Manstein Plan"
    GER_fall_gelb_desc:0 "The Maginot Line is not impenetrable, but would cause us horrendous losses if we were to smash into it head on. Erich von Manstein has devised a cunning strategy where we shall aggressively cut through the Low Counties to the Atlantic, bypassing France's defenses entirely and defeating the western allies in a war of movement. To do this, however, we must invade all three Benelux nations simultaneously..."
    GER_case_barbarossa:0 "Operation: Barbarossa"
    GER_case_barbarossa_desc:0 "The bulk of the Russian Army stationed in Western Russia will be destroyed by daring operations led by deeply penetrating armoured spearheads. Russian forces still capable of giving battle will be prevented from withdrawing into the depths of Russia. The enemy will then be energetically pursued and a line will be reached from which the Russian Air Force can no longer attack German territory. The final objective of the operation is to erect a barrier against Asiatic Russia on the general line Volga-Archangel. The last surviving industrial area of Russia in the Urals can then, if necessary be eliminated by the Air Force. The Army will have to employ all available formations to this end, with the reservation that occupied territories must be insured against surprise attacks."
